# SliderPuzzle
A simple slider puzzle that I created in Java. It supports local and remote images of any resolution. Run configurations will be listed  in the README.

Run Configurations: ('#' and '$' should not be included during the run process.)<br>
"java Start" - Starts a new 4 x 4 Slider Puzzle with White pieces.<br>
"java Start #cols #rows" - Starts a new cols x rows Slider Puzzle with White pieces.<br>
"java Start #cols #rows $imgPath" - Starts a new cols x rows Slider Puzzle with pieces based from supplied imgPath.<br>
NOTE: The above config supports local images(on your computer) and remote images(from a website).<br>
      This means you can do a Slider Puzzle of your favorite image without having to download it!
